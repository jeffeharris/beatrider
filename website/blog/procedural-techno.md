# Procedural Techno: Detroit to Berlin in Code

Each city's techno scene has its own signatureâ€”Detroit's soulful minimalism, Berlin's industrial darkness, Chicago's acid house roots. The challenge was encoding these cultural patterns into algorithmic rules.

## The Sound of Cities

### Detroit
- Warm, melodic, hopeful
- Complex hi-hat patterns
- Jazz-influenced chord progressions
- The birthplace feeling

### Berlin
- Dark, industrial, relentless
- Minimal but massive
- Dissonant stabs
- 4am in Berghain energy

### Chicago
- Acid basslines that squelch and scream
- House music's groove
- Classic 303 patterns
- Warehouse party vibes

## Pattern Banks

Each style has its own pattern bank:

```javascript
const patterns = {
  detroit: {
    kick:  [1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0],
    hihat: [0,0,1,0, 1,0,1,1, 0,0,1,0, 1,0,1,0],
    chord: ['Cm7', 'Fm7', 'Gm7', 'Fm7']
  },
  berlin: {
    kick:  [1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0],
    hihat: [0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0],
    chord: ['Cm', 'Cm', 'Gm', 'G#']
  }
}
```

## The Acid Algorithm

The 303 emulation uses dual filters with resonance:

1. **Filter 1**: Frequency tracks the pattern energy
2. **Filter 2**: Q (resonance) creates the "acid" sound
3. **Glide**: Portamento between notes for that classic slide

## Generative Structure

The music follows EDM arrangement patterns:

- **INTRO** (8 bars): Kick and hi-hat only
- **BUILD** (8 bars): Add bass, increase energy
- **MAIN** (16 bars): Full arrangement, peak energy
- **BREAK** (8 bars): Remove kick, ambient moment
- **DROP** (16 bars): Everything returns with maximum impact
- **OUTRO** (8 bars): Gradual reduction

## The Magic

The patterns are just data, but the *selection* is where the magic happens. Probability matrices determine which patterns play when, creating endless variations that still feel "correct" for each style.

The result: Every playthrough generates a unique track that could have come from a Detroit warehouse, a Berlin bunker, or a Chicago loft. The code becomes the DJ.
