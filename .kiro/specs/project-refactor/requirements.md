# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Beatrider project uses a single-file HTML architecture where all code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is contained within `index.html`. While this approach works for prototyping, it creates significant maintainability, scalability, and development workflow issues. This refactor will modernize the project structure while preserving all existing functionality and the core design philosophy of simplicity and easy deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper project structure with separated concerns, so that I can maintain and extend the codebase efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the project SHALL have separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN viewing the project structure THEN it SHALL follow modern web development conventions
3. WHEN making changes to styling THEN developers SHALL be able to edit CSS files without touching HTML or JavaScript
4. WHEN adding new game features THEN developers SHALL be able to work in dedicated JavaScript modules
5. WHEN multiple developers work on the project THEN they SHALL be able to work on different files without conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern build system, so that I can use development tools and maintain the single-file deployment advantage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading and development server
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate a single HTML file for easy deployment
3. WHEN using the build system THEN it SHALL preserve all existing functionality
4. WHEN deploying THEN the output SHALL be compatible with static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
5. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL optimize assets and bundle dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular JavaScript architecture, so that I can organize game logic, audio engine, and UI components separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN audio engine code SHALL be in dedicated modules
2. WHEN looking at game logic THEN it SHALL be separated from audio and UI code
3. WHEN working on UI components THEN they SHALL be in their own modules
4. WHEN adding new features THEN the module system SHALL support easy extension
5. WHEN debugging THEN developers SHALL be able to isolate issues to specific modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper CSS organization, so that I can maintain the retro aesthetic while keeping styles manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing CSS files THEN they SHALL be organized by component/feature
2. WHEN working on responsive design THEN media queries SHALL be clearly organized
3. WHEN maintaining the retro theme THEN CSS custom properties SHALL be used for consistent theming
4. WHEN adding new UI components THEN the CSS architecture SHALL support modular styling
5. WHEN building THEN CSS SHALL be optimized and minified for production

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern development tooling, so that I can use linting, formatting, and other quality tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN ESLint SHALL enforce consistent JavaScript style
2. WHEN formatting code THEN Prettier SHALL maintain consistent formatting
3. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL run quality checks
4. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support source maps for debugging
5. WHEN using the tooling THEN it SHALL integrate with common editors and IDEs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality preserved, so that the refactor doesn't break the game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN playing the game THEN all current features SHALL work identically
2. WHEN using audio controls THEN the procedural music system SHALL function unchanged
3. WHEN accessing settings THEN all configuration options SHALL be available
4. WHEN installing as PWA THEN the app SHALL remain installable and work offline
5. WHEN deploying THEN the final output SHALL be a single HTML file as before

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and setup instructions, so that new contributors can easily start working on the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN clear installation instructions SHALL be provided
2. WHEN contributing THEN development workflow documentation SHALL be available
3. WHEN building THEN build process documentation SHALL explain all steps
4. WHEN deploying THEN deployment instructions SHALL cover all supported platforms
5. WHEN onboarding THEN the project structure SHALL be clearly documented
